# Greeting App for AWS

Personal test for an AWS "micro-services" stack with terraform, rails, go and redis.

- api: contains the go api
- dev: contains files to run the stack in local
- metadatastore: contains the rails api to communicate with the redis instance
- stack: contains the terraform code to deploy the stack on aws
- ui: contains the code for the front-end (vanilla js)
